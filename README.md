# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using MNIST Dataset
*Welcome to the "Handwritten Digit Recognition" project repository! ðŸ“Š In this project, we have developed a powerful system that can recognize and classify handwritten digits from scanned images. This project was built using Neural Networks and the popular MNIST dataset.*

# Project Overview
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The objective of this project is to automatically identify and classify digits (0-9) that have been handwritten on paper. Here's an overview of the key components of this project:

**Data Preparation:** We used the MNIST dataset, which consists of a large number of handwritten digit images. This dataset was split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate our model.

**Neural Network Model:** We designed and implemented a neural network architecture suitable for image classification tasks. This neural network was trained on the training dataset to learn the patterns and features of handwritten digits.

**Training:** During the training phase, the neural network learned to recognize and differentiate between different digits. We used techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize the model's parameters.

**Testing and Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using the test dataset. We measured various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess how well the model can classify handwritten digits.

**Inference:** Once trained and tested, the model can be used for inference. Given a scanned image of a handwritten digit, the model predicts the digit it represents.

**Deployment:** If you wish to deploy this model in your own applications, you'll find instructions on how to load and use it in the deployment folder.
